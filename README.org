* Git Guts

This repo holds the code from my git guts articles on [[https://killring.io][killring.io]].

- [[https://killring.io/post/git-guts-pack-index][The Pack Index]] :: Dig through git's pack file index
- The Pack File :: Grub around in git's pack file and wrangle objects
- Loose Objects :: Hang loose with git's loose object format
- The Index :: Use the index to figure out what's what

And maybe more?
